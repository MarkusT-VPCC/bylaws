\begin{easylist}
&& Interpretations 
    &&& In any situations where this Bylaw contradicts Bylaw 1, Bylaw 1 shall have precedence.
    &&& It is imperative that Discipline Clubs be given the autonomy to conduct their business. Although autonomy is important, the Society must have a presence to ensure accountability and financial prudence are maintained. 

&& General
    &&& All Discipline Clubs shall have the benefits of Associated Entities. 
    &&& There shall be one (1) Discipline Club per Engineering program as defined by the Lassonde School of Engineering. 
    &&& Each Discipline Club shall be represented by a Club President or Co-Presidents.

    &&& Each Discipline Club Constitution shall clearly state that the Discipline Club Officers must be elected through the Engineering Society, barring extraneous circumstances, as defined in Bylaw 5. 
    &&& Amendments to a Discipline Club's Constitution shall be binding given a passing vote by the Board and the Discipline Club as defined in Bylaw 1 and the Discipline Club's Constitution. 

&& Eligibility

\section{Hallo}

\ListProperties(Start2=0)
\begin{easylist}
&& Hallo
    &&& Each Discipline Club shall receive a minimum per annum budget allocation of CAD 500 plus CAD 0.8 per student. 
        &&&& Discipline Club Financing shall be treated as a mandatory expenditure in the Society's budgeting process.
    &&& The Board may use its budgetary discretion to withhold Discipline Club funding for the following reasons: 
        &&&& The club does not have a constitution that has been ratified by the Board or is not in compliance with its Board-approved constitution.
        &&&& The club does not have an operating budget that has been recommended by the Finance Committee.
        &&&& The club has not run elections in compliance with the Societyâ€™s bylaws.
    &&& In cases where no Chair has been elected, an Interim President may be appointed and the requirements for funding in 2.0.2.c be waived.    
        &&&& Should a Discipline Club choose to appoint an Interim President, the process for doing so must be clearly outlined in its constitution.
        &&&& In cases where an Interim President is appointed, the position of President must be opened for nominations in the next applicable election cycle.
    &&& A Discipline Club is required, upon the request of the Board of Directors, to release a current budget and up-to-date record of financial transactions within thirty (30) days of
such a request.
